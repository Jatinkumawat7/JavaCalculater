# Java Console Calculator

## Objective
Build a basic calculator using Java console input/output to perform arithmetic operations.

## Key Features
- Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Menu-driven interface for easy operation selection
- Accepts user input using `Scanner`
- Allows multiple calculations until the user chooses to exit

## Project Structure
- **Calculator class** – Contains methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- **Main class** – Handles user input, menu navigation, and calls Calculator methods

## Key Concepts
- **OOP:** Methods for different operations
- **Conditionals:** Switch or if-else for operation selection
- **Loops:** Allow repeated calculations
- **I/O:** Using `Scanner` for user input

## Learning Outcome
- Practice Java syntax and logical flow
- Understand method creation and calling
- Gain experience with loops, conditionals, and console-based I/O
